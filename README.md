# Java Web App CI/CD Pipeline with Jenkins

This project demonstrates a complete CI/CD pipeline setup using Jenkins for a Java web application built with Gradle and deployed to an Apache Tomcat server.

## üìå Project Overview

The pipeline performs the following tasks:

1. **Clones** the source code from a GitHub repository.
2. **Builds** the Java web application using Gradle.
3. **Verifies** the generated WAR file.
4. **Deploys** the WAR file to a local Apache Tomcat server.
5. **Restarts** the Tomcat server to apply the latest deployment.

## üöÄ Tools & Technologies

- **Jenkins** ‚Äì Automation server to run CI/CD pipeline
- **Gradle** ‚Äì Build automation tool for Java
- **Git** ‚Äì Version control system
- **Apache Tomcat** ‚Äì Web server for deploying Java web apps
- **Shell Scripts** ‚Äì For build and deployment steps

## üõ†Ô∏è Jenkins Pipeline Configuration

The Jenkins pipeline is written in Declarative syntax and includes the following stages:

- **Checkout Code**
- **Build with Gradle**
- **Verify WAR File**
- **Deploy WAR to Tomcat**
